# Word Frequency Counter

This project counts the frequency of words in a paragraph and displays the most frequently occurring words on a webpage. It focuses on identifying and displaying the top words and their frequency in descending order.

## Features

- **Word Count**: Parses a paragraph to count the occurrences of each word.
- **Case Insensitivity**: The program treats all words as lowercase to ensure accurate counting.
- **Top Words Display**: Displays the top most frequent words and how many times they occurred.
- **Cleaning Text**: Removes punctuation and special characters to ensure only words are counted.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Structure of the page.
- **JavaScript**: Logic for counting and sorting the words.

## How It Works

1. The script takes a block of text (paragraph), converts it to lowercase, and removes punctuation.
2. It then counts the occurrences of each word.
3. The words are sorted by their frequency in descending order.
4. The top words along with their count are dynamically added to the HTML page.

## Installation and Usage
